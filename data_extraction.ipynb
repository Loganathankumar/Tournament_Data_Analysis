        "*   The dataset contains 15 female players and 124 male players after initial gender separation.\n",
        "*   A total of 14 female players and 98 male players were required to form 14 teams, each with 1 female and 7 male players.\n",
        "*   All 14 teams were successfully formed by randomly selecting players without replacement.\n",
        "*   After forming the 14 teams, 1 female player and 26 male players remained unassigned.\n",
